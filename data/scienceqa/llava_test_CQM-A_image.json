One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Gordon's test show?\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Edwin thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Edwin's test show?\nOptions: (A) how much athletes would sweat in the fabric (B) if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second (C) how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\n<image>"

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Robert's test show?\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins.

As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.\nThe captain of the Isleifur II first thought the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. But as the Isleifur II approached the column of smoke, the captain and crew saw glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat. It was a volcano erupting under the water!\nFigure: the erupting undersea volcano seen by the sailors on the Isleifur II.\nQuestion: According to the text, what evidence of a volcanic eruption did the captain observe?\nOptions: (A) He heard a report on the radio warning about a volcanic eruption. (B) He saw a nearby boat that was on fire. (C) He smelled sulfur and saw pieces of molten rock shooting out of the water.\n<image>"

Analogous structures are parts with the same purpose but with different structures, like a fin and a flipper. Different species may develop analogous structures when they live in similar environments even if they aren't closely related.\nHomologous structures, however, may show that species are related by indicating they have common ancestors. A whale is a mammal, which makes it more closely related to a bear than to a fish, and a whale's flipper has bones like those in a bear's paw. Though they are different shapes and sizes, the arrangement of bones is similar.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: (A) analogous structures (B) homologous structure\n<image>"

Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Bridget's test show?\nOptions: (A) whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster (B) whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin (C) whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin\n<image>"

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nMuscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.\nOne of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.\nFigure: muscles in the human body.\nQuestion: Complete the sentence.\nThe mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().\nOptions: (A) chloride channel protein . . .

For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning\n<image>"

Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nQuestion: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses. (B) The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers. (C) The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice. (D) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.\n<image>"

Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged.\nOne property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor.\nSyrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones.\nSubstances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both.\nOne example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true?\nOptions: (A) A flavorant might be both found in nature and made in a chemical factory. (B) A substance's chemical structure depends only on the number and types of atoms in each molecule of the substance.\n<image>"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Kenji's test show?\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

Cats meow to talk with their humans!\nIf you are a cat owner, you may be interested in understanding your cat's meows. Different meows can have distinct meanings. A short, high squeak or chirp is a cheerful hello. A louder and longer meow is a cat's way of saying \"Please?\" or \"Let me out!\" An even longer and louder meow is your cat's way of demanding something, like \"Food! Now!\" Of course, the best cat sound to many cat owners is a low, rumbling purr that comes from a happy cat.\nQuestion: Why do adult cats meow?\nOptions: (A) to act like kittens (B) to talk to other cats (C) to talk to people\n<image>"

In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nQuestion: Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.\n<image>"

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Duncan's test show?\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\n<image>"

Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.\nIn a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.\nQuestion: What is the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth?

But over time, the filter would become clogged with bacteria. If the filter became clogged, the water would not move through quickly enough. Logan had to decide when the filter was too clogged and needed to be replaced. So, during his inspection, Logan checked the filter by measuring how quickly water moved through it.\nFigure: an engineer at a water treatment plant.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Logan's test show?\nOptions: (A) whether the filter was clogged (B) the amount of bacteria in the water before it was filtered (C) whether an inexpensive filter would become clogged more often\n<image>"

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Manny put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Manny's test show?\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

Filtration involves straining unwanted materials, sometimes with the help of gravity. For example, you can pour a liquid mixture through a funnel lined with filter paper that collects unwanted solids.\nCentrifugation, on the other hand, uses centrifugal force to separate materials. For example, vials of mixtures can be placed at an angle in special machines that spin at high speed. The spinning causes denser substances to move and collect at the bottom of the vial.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: (A) filtration (B) centrifugation\n<image>"
